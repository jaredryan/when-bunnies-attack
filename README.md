The RPG project is a text game that runs in the terminal through node. It contains 1000+ lines of code that that allows the user to play an RPG with scary bunnies. The game's mechanics and systems required a large amount of organized code, and a decent amount of code consists of lines of dialogue.

The games includes the following:
- A main character
- Random enemies
- Forced encounters
- Requests and uses user input to make decisions or gather information
- Interactive--if the user makes certain decisions, new decisions become available
- A turn-based fight system, where the player can attack, flee, or use items
- Defeating an enemy nets the player items and some health
- A navigation system to go from room to room as the player desires
- The ability to print the current status at any time
- The ability to quit the game at almost any time
