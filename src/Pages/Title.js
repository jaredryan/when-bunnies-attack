      My first experimental game, built from scratch with love and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a simple game: 10-15 minutes long, and no save feature, so make sure
      you got the time before diving in, and don't refresh the page â€” you'll have
      to start over.
    </p>
    <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
